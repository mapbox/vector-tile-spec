# Vector Tile Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

This is version 3.0 of the specification. It is mostly backwards compatible to previous versions.

## 1. Purpose

This document specifies a space-efficient encoding format for tiled geographic vector data. It is designed to be used in browsers or server-side applications for fast rendering or lookups of feature data.

## 2. File Format

The Vector Tile format uses [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) as a encoding format. Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.

### 2.1. File Extension

The filename extension for Vector Tile files SHOULD be `mvt`. For example, a file might be named `vector.mvt`.

### 2.2. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)

When serving Vector Tiles the MIME type SHOULD be `application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile`.

## 3. Projection and Bounds

A Vector Tile represents data based on a square extent within a projection. A Vector Tile SHOULD NOT contain information about its bounds and projection. The file format assumes that the decoder knows the bounds and projection of a Vector Tile before decoding it.

[Web Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Mercator) is the projection of reference, and [the Google tile scheme](http://www.maptiler.org/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/) is the tile extent convention of reference. Together, they provide a 1-to-1 relationship between a specific geographical area, at a specific level of detail, and a path such as `https://example.com/17/65535/43602.mvt`.

Vector Tiles MAY be used to represent data with any projection and tile extent scheme.

## 4. Internal Structure

This specification describes the structure of data within a Vector Tile. The reader should have an understanding of the [Vector Tile protobuf schema document](vector_tile.proto) and the structures it defines.

### 4.1. Layers

A Vector Tile consists of a set of named layers. A layer contains geometric features and their metadata. The layer format is designed so that the data required for a layer is contiguous in memory, and so that layers can be appended to a Vector Tile without modifying existing data.

A Vector Tile SHOULD contain at least one layer. A layer SHOULD contain at least one feature.

A layer MUST contain a `version` field with the major version number of the Vector Tile specification to which the layer adheres. For example, a layer adhering to version 3.0 of the specification contains a `version` field with the integer value `3`. The `version` field SHOULD be the first field within the layer. Decoders SHOULD parse the `version` first to ensure that they are capable of decoding each layer. When a Vector Tile consumer encounters a Vector Tile layer with an unknown version, it MAY make a best-effort attempt to interpret the layer, or it MAY skip the layer. In either case it SHOULD continue to process subsequent layers in the Vector Tile.

A layer MUST contain a non-empty `name` field. A Vector Tile MUST NOT contain two or more layers whose `name` values are byte-for-byte identical. Prior to appending a layer to an existing Vector Tile, an encoder MUST check the existing `name` fields in order to prevent duplication.

A layer MUST contain an `extent` that describes the width and height of the tile in integer coordinates. The geometries within the Vector Tile MAY extend past the bounds of the tile's area as defined by the `extent`. Geometries that extend past the tile's area as defined by `extent` are often used as a buffer for rendering features that overlap multiple adjacent tiles.

For example, if a tile has an `extent` of 4096, coordinate units within the tile refer to 1/4096th of its square dimensions. A coordinate of 0 is on the top or left edge of the tile, and a coordinate of 4096 is on the bottom or right edge. Coordinates from 1 through 4095 inclusive are fully within the extent of the tile, and coordinates less than 0 or greater than 4096 are fully outside the extent of the tile.  A point at `(1,10)` or `(4095,10)` is within the extent of the tile. A point at `(0,10)` or `(4096,10)` is on the edge of the extent. A point at `(-1,10)` or `(4097,10)` is outside the extent of the tile.

A layer MAY contain information about its tile location in the `tile_x`, `tile_y`, and `tile_zoom` fields. If you have one of these fields you MUST have the other tile locations fields. These fields were introduced first in version 3.0 of the specification. If you create a new layer, it is recommended that you fill in these fields. `tile_zoom` MUST be between 0 and 31. `tile_x` and `tile_y` MUST be between 0 and `tile_zoom<sup>2</sup> - 1`.

Each feature in a layer (see below) may have one or more key-value pairs as its attribute data. Keys and some types of values refer back to dictionaries stored in the layer in the fields `keys`, `values`, `string_values`, `float_values`, `double_values`, and `int_values`. Which fields are used depends on the type of attribute encoding used. Please reference section 4.4 for all specific rules governing these fields.

Layer MAY contain an `elevation_scaling` and `attribute_scalings` fields. See section 4.4.2.5 for details.

### 4.2. Features

A feature MUST contain a `geometry` field.

A feature MUST contain a `type` field as described in the Geometry Types section.

A feature stores its attributes either in the `tags` field or in the `attributes` and `geometric_attributes` fields. Please see section 4.4 for the rules governing these fields.

#### 4.2.1. Integer and String Identifier

A feature MAY contain an `id` or `string_id` field, but MUST NOT contain both. If a feature has an `id` field, the value of the `id` SHOULD be unique among the features of the parent layer. If a feature has a `string_id` field, the value of the `string_id` SHOULD be unique among the features of the parent layer. Numeric values in the `string_id` are not considered to be the same values as an integer `id` value. A `string_id` that is empty is considered to be the same as not having a `string_id` field, therefore, a `string_id` MUST NOT be empty.

### 4.3. Geometry Encoding

Each feature in a Vector Tile MUST have exactly one geometry of type point, multipoint, linestring, multilinestring, polygon, multipolygon, spline, or multispline. In addition an "UNKNOWN" geometry type is available for experimental use. Geometries can be 2D or 3D.

Geometry data in a Vector Tile is defined in a screen coordinate system. The upper left corner of the tile (as displayed by default) is the origin of the coordinate system. The X axis is positive to the right, and the Y axis is positive downward. Coordinates within a geometry MUST be integers.

A geometry is encoded as a sequence of 32 bit unsigned integers in the `geometry` field of a feature. Each integer is either a `CommandInteger` or a `ParameterInteger`. A decoder interprets these as an ordered series of operations to generate the geometry.

Commands refer to positions relative to a "cursor", which is a redefinable point. For the first command in a feature, the cursor is at `(0,0)` in the coordinate system. Some commands move the cursor, affecting subsequent commands.

#### 4.3.1. Command Integers

A `CommandInteger` indicates a command to be executed, as a command ID, and the number of times that the command will be executed, as a command count.

A command ID is encoded as an unsigned integer in the least significant 3 bits of the `CommandInteger`, and is in the range 0 through 7, inclusive. A command count is encoded as an unsigned integer in the remaining 29 bits of a `CommandInteger`, and is in the range `0` through `pow(2, 29) - 1`, inclusive.

A command ID, a command count, and a `CommandInteger` are related by these bitwise operations:

```javascript
CommandInteger = (id & 0x7) | (count << 3)
```

```javascript
id = CommandInteger & 0x7
```

```javascript
count = CommandInteger >> 3
```

A command ID specifies one of the following commands:

|  Command     |  Id  | Parameters    | Parameter Count |
| ------------ |:----:| ------------- | --------------- |
| MoveTo       | `1`  | `dX`, `dY`    | 2               |
| LineTo       | `2`  | `dX`, `dY`    | 2               |
| ClosePath    | `7`  | No parameters | 0               |

##### 4.3.1.1. Example Command Integers

| Command   |  ID  | Count | CommandInteger | Binary Representation `[Count][Id]`      |
| --------- |:----:|:-----:|:--------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
| MoveTo    | `1`  | `1`   | `9`            | `[00000000 00000000 0000000 00001][001]` |
| MoveTo    | `1`  | `120` | `961`          | `[00000000 00000000 0000011 11000][001]` |
| LineTo    | `2`  | `1`   | `10`           | `[00000000 00000000 0000000 00001][010]` |
| LineTo    | `2`  | `3`   | `26`           | `[00000000 00000000 0000000 00011][010]` |
| ClosePath | `7`  | `1`   | `15`           | `[00000000 00000000 0000000 00001][111]` |


#### 4.3.2. Parameter Integers

Commands requiring parameters are followed by a `ParameterInteger` for each parameter required by that command. The number of `ParameterIntegers` that follow a `CommandInteger` is equal to the parameter count of a command multiplied by the command count of the `CommandInteger`. For example, a `CommandInteger` with a `MoveTo` command with a command count of 3 will be followed by 6 `ParameterIntegers`.

A `ParameterInteger` is [zigzag](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#types) encoded so that small negative and positive values are both encoded as small integers. To encode a parameter value to a `ParameterInteger` the following formula is used:

```javascript
ParameterInteger = (value << 1) ^ (value >> 31)
```

Parameter values greater than `pow(2,31) - 1` or less than `-1 * (pow(2,31) - 1)` are not supported.

The following formula is used to decode a `ParameterInteger` to a value:

```javascript
value = ((ParameterInteger >> 1) ^ (-(ParameterInteger & 1)))
```

#### 4.3.3. Command Types

For all descriptions of commands the initial position of the cursor shall be described to be at the coordinates `(cX, cY)` where `cX` is the position of the cursor on the X axis and `cY` is the position of the `cursor` on the Y axis.

##### 4.3.3.1. MoveTo Command

A `MoveTo` command with a command count of `n` MUST be immediately followed by `n` pairs of `ParameterInteger`s. Each pair `(dX, dY)`:

1. Defines the coordinate `(pX, pY)`, where `pX = cX + dX` and `pY = cY + dY`.
   * Within POINT geometries, this coordinate defines a new point.
   * Within LINESTRING geometries, this coordinate defines the starting vertex of a new line.
   * Within POLYGON geometries, this coordinate defines the starting vertex of a new linear ring.
2. Moves the cursor to `(pX, pY)`.

##### 4.3.3.2. LineTo Command

A `LineTo` command with a command count of `n` MUST be immediately followed by `n` pairs of `ParameterInteger`s. Each pair `(dX, dY)`:

1. Defines a segment beginning at the cursor `(cX, cY)` and ending at the coordinate `(pX, pY)`, where `pX = cX + dX` and `pY = cY + dY`.
   * Within LINESTRING geometries, this segment extends the current line.
   * Within POLYGON geometries, this segment extends the current linear ring.
2. Moves the cursor to `(pX, pY)`.

For any pair of `(dX, dY)` the `dX` and `dY` MUST NOT both be `0`.

##### 4.3.3.3. ClosePath Command

A `ClosePath` command MUST have a command count of 1 and no parameters. The command closes the current linear ring of a POLYGON geometry via a line segment beginning at the cursor `(cX, cY)` and ending at the starting vertex of the current linear ring.

This command does not change the cursor position.

#### 4.3.4. Elevations

In addition to the ground locations encoded in the `geometry`, a Feature may also contain elevation data.

If present, the `elevation` field contains one signed integer per vertex in the `geometry`. These integers encode integer elevation steps as deltas from an initial state of 0. Note that no `elevation` is specified for the `ClosePath` operations, since the elevation must be the same as the initial point. (This is different for the `geometric_attributes`, where the `ClosePath` operation does have associated data.)

If an `elevation_scaling` message is present in the Layer, these integer elevations are further scaled and offset according to the Scaling rules described below.

Elevations, whether integer or scaled, are interpreted as distances in meters above the WGS84 spheroid.

Polygon and multipolygon features SHOULD NOT include an `elevation` field, because the elevation of locations in the interior of a polygon is not sufficiently well defined by the elevation of points on the exterior. A future revision of this specification may specify semantics for polygon elevations.

Software that doesn't understand the `elevation` and `elevation_scaling` fields can still interpret the geometries as 2D geometries.

#### 4.3.5. Geometry Types

The `geometry` field is described in each feature by the `type` field which must be a value in the enum `GeomType`. The following geometry types are supported:

* UNKNOWN
* POINT
* LINESTRING
* POLYGON
* SPLINE

The geometry type does not differentiate between "single" and "multi" geometry types such as between point and multipoint. It also doesn't differentiate between 2D and 3D geometries.

Geometry collections are not supported.

##### 4.3.5.1. Unknown Geometry Type

The specification purposefully leaves an unknown geometry type as an option. This geometry type encodes experimental geometry types that an encoder MAY choose to implement. Decoders MAY ignore any features of this geometry type.

##### 4.3.5.2. Point Geometry Type

The `POINT` geometry type encodes a point or multipoint geometry. The geometry command sequence for a point geometry MUST consist of a single `MoveTo` command with a command count greater than 0.

If the `MoveTo` command for a `POINT` geometry has a command count of 1, then the geometry MUST be interpreted as a single point; otherwise the geometry MUST be interpreted as a multipoint geometry, wherein each pair of `ParameterInteger`s encodes a single point.

##### 4.3.5.3. Linestring Geometry Type

The `LINESTRING` geometry type encodes a linestring or multilinestring geometry. The geometry command sequence for a linestring geometry MUST consist of one or more repetitions of the following sequence:

1. A `MoveTo` command with a command count of 1
2. A `LineTo` command with a command count greater than 0

If the command sequence for a `LINESTRING` geometry type includes only a single `MoveTo` command then the geometry MUST be interpreted as a single linestring; otherwise the geometry MUST be interpreted as a multilinestring geometry, wherein each `MoveTo` signals the beginning of a new linestring.

##### 4.3.5.4. Polygon Geometry Type

The `POLYGON` geometry type encodes a polygon or multipolygon geometry, each polygon consisting of exactly one exterior ring that contains zero or more interior rings. The geometry command sequence for a polygon consists of one or more repetitions of the following sequence:

1. An `ExteriorRing`
2. Zero or more `InteriorRing`s

Each `ExteriorRing` and `InteriorRing` MUST consist of the following sequence:

1. A `MoveTo` command with a command count of 1
2. A `LineTo` command with a command count greater than 1
3. A `ClosePath` command

An exterior ring is DEFINED as a linear ring having a positive area as calculated by applying the [surveyor's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) to the vertices of the polygon in tile coordinates. In the tile coordinate system (with the Y axis positive down and X axis positive to the right) this makes the exterior ring's winding order appear clockwise.

An interior ring is DEFINED as a linear ring having a negative area as calculated by applying the [surveyor's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) to the vertices of the polygon in tile coordinates. In the tile coordinate system (with the Y axis positive down and X axis positive to the right) this makes the interior ring's winding order appear counterclockwise.

If the command sequence for a `POLYGON` geometry type includes only a single exterior ring then the geometry MUST be interpreted as a single polygon; otherwise the geometry MUST be interpreted as a multipolygon geometry, wherein each exterior ring signals the beginning of a new polygon. If a polygon has interior rings they MUST be encoded directly after the exterior ring of the polygon to which they belong.

Linear rings MUST be geometric objects that have no anomalous geometric points, such as self-intersection or self-tangency. The position of the cursor before calling the `ClosePath` command of a linear ring SHALL NOT repeat the same position as the first point in the linear ring as this would create a zero-length line segment. A linear ring SHOULD NOT have an area calculated by the surveyor's formula equal to zero, as this would signify a ring with anomalous geometric points.

Polygon geometries MUST NOT have any interior rings that intersect and interior rings MUST be enclosed by the exterior ring.

##### 4.3.5.5. Spline Geometry Type

The `SPLINE` geometry type encodes a curve geometry in the form of a b-spline or basis spline. Unlike other geometry types, `SPLINE` requires the use of multiple fields in a feature. A spline geometry MUST have control points in the `geometry` field and knots in the `spline_knots` field. A spline geometry MAY have a degree of 2 or 3 in the `spline_degree` field.

If a `SPLINE` geometry does not provide a degree in the `spline_degree` field, the degree is considered to be 2.

The command sequence in the `geometry` field for the control points in a spline geometry MUST consist of one or more repetitions of the following sequence:

1. A `MoveTo` command with a command count of 1
2. A `LineTo` command with a command count greater than 0

If the command sequence for a `SPLINE` geometry type includes only a single `MoveTo` command then the geometry MUST be interpreted as a single b-spline; otherwise the geometry MUST be interpreted as a multi b-spline geometry, wherein each `MoveTo` signals the beginning of a new b-spline.

The `spline_knots` field MUST contain a sequence of structured values, each of which MUST be of the number-list type, as defined in section 4.4.2.2 below. The number of such structured values MUST be the same as the number of b-splines specified in the `geometry`.

Each b-spline defined in the `geometry` field corresponds in sequence to one list of knot values in the `spline_knots` field. Each list of knot values for a b-spline MUST contain exactly the number of knot values defined by the following formula: `number_of_knots = number_of_control_points + degree + 1`.

#### 4.3.6. Example Geometry Encodings

##### 4.3.6.1. Example Point

An example encoding of a point located at:

* (25,17)

This would require a single command:

* MoveTo(+25, +17)

```

```

##### 4.3.6.3. Example Linestring

An example encoding of a line with the points:

* (2,2)
* (2,10)
* (10,10)

This would require three commands:

* MoveTo(+2,+2)
* LineTo(+0,+8)
* LineTo(+8,+0)

```
Encoded as: [ 9 4 4 18 0 16 16 0 ]
              |      |      ==== relative LineTo(+8, +0) == Line to Point (10, 10)
              |      | ==== relative LineTo(+0, +8) == Line to Point (2, 10)
              |      `> [00010 010] = command id 2 (LineTo), command count 2
              | === relative MoveTo(+2, +2)
              `> [00001 001] = command id 1 (MoveTo), command count 1
```

##### 4.3.6.4. Example Multilinestring

An example encoding of two lines with the points:

* Line 1:
  * (2,2)
  * (2,10)
  * (10,10)
* Line 2:

* LineTo(+2,+4)

```
Encoded as: [ 9 4 4 18 0 16 16 0 9 17 17 10 4 8 ]
              |      |           |        | === relative LineTo(+2, +4) == Line to Point (3,5)
              |      |           |        `> [00001 010] = command id 2 (LineTo), command count 1
              |      |           | ===== relative MoveTo(-9, -9) == Start new line at (1,1)

              |      | ==== relative LineTo(+0, +8) == Line to Point (2, 10)
              |      `> [00010 010] = command id 2 (LineTo), command count 2
              | === relative MoveTo(+2, +2)
              `> [00001 001] = command id 1 (MoveTo), command count 1
```

##### 4.3.6.5. Example Polygon

An example encoding of a polygon feature that has the points:

* (3,6)
* (8,12)
* (20,34)
* (3,6) *Path Closing as Last Point*

Would encoded by using the following commands:

* MoveTo(3, 6)
* LineTo(5, 6)
* LineTo(12, 22)
* ClosePath

```
Encoded as: [ 9 6 12 18 10 12 24 44 15 ]
              |       |              `> [00001 111] command id 7 (ClosePath), command count 1
              |       |       ===== relative LineTo(+12, +22) == Line to Point (20, 34)
              |       | ===== relative LineTo(+5, +6) == Line to Point (8, 12)

              | ==== relative MoveTo(+3, +6)
              `> [00001 001] = command id 1 (MoveTo), command count 1
```

##### 4.3.6.6. Example Multipolygon

An example of a more complex encoding of two polygons, one with a hole. The position of the points for the polygons are shown below. The winding order of the polygons is VERY important in this example as it signifies the difference between interior rings and a new polygon.

* Polygon 1:
  * Exterior Ring:
    * (0,0)
    * (10,0)
    * (10,10)
    * (0,10)
    * (0,0) *Path Closing as Last Point*
* Polygon 2:
  * Exterior Ring:
    * (11,11)
    * (20,11)
    * (20,20)
    * (11,20)
    * (11,11) *Path Closing as Last Point*
  * Interior Ring:
    * (13,13)
    * (13,17)
    * (17,17)
    * (17,13)
    * (13,13) *Path Closing as Last Point*

This polygon would be encoded with the following set of commands:

* MoveTo(+0,+0)
* LineTo(+10,+0)
* LineTo(+0,+10)
* LineTo(-10,+0) // Cursor at 0,10 after this command
* ClosePath // End of Polygon 1
* MoveTo(+11,+1) // NOTE THAT THIS IS RELATIVE TO LAST LINETO!
* LineTo(+9,+0)
* LineTo(+0,+9)
* LineTo(-9,+0) // Cursor at 11,20 after this command
* ClosePath // This is a new polygon because area is positive!
* MoveTo(+2,-7) // NOTE THAT THIS IS RELATIVE TO LAST LINETO!
* LineTo(+0,+4)
* LineTo(+4,+0)
* LineTo(+0,-4) // Cursor at 17,13
* ClosePath // This is an interior ring because area is negative!

### 4.4. Feature Attributes

There are two different ways that feature attributes MAY be encoded within a `layer`. In this document the first way shall be defined as Legacy Attributes and the second as Inline Attributes.  Any single `layer` MUST NOT use both Inline and Legacy Attributes. Both of these forms of attributes are considered valid and a decoder of Vector Tiles MUST support both versions. A valid encoder MAY use either of the forms of attributes but SHOULD prefer the use of Inline Attributes. Legacy Attributes are considered obsolescent and the use of Inline Attributes is encouraged.

#### 4.4.1. Legacy Attributes

Legacy attributes are the way in which attribute data was encoded in Vector Tiles in version 2 and below. They are still supported as a valid way to encode Attributes, but lack some of the features that are available with Inline Attributes.

Legacy Attributes use the `keys` and `values` fields in a `layer` and the `tags` field in a `feature`. If Legacy Attributes are used, the `string_values`, `float_values`, `double_values`, and `int_values` in a `layer` and the `attributes` and `geometric_attributes` fields in a `feature` MUST NOT be used.

Legacy attributes are encoded as pairs of integers in the `tags` field of a feature. The first integer in each pair represents the zero-based index of the key in the `keys` set of the `layer` to which the feature belongs. The second integer in each pair represents the zero-based index of the value in the `values` set of the `layer` to which the feature belongs. Each key index MUST be unique within each feature, such that no other attribute pair within the same feature has the same key index. A feature MUST have an even number of `tags` fields. A feature `tags` field MUST NOT contain a key index or value index greater than or equal to the number of elements in the layer's `keys` or `values` set, respectively.

##### 4.4.1.1. Legacy Attribute Values

When using Legacy Attributes, values are stored as repeated Value messages in the `values` field of a layer and will be referenced by index in a Feature. Each element in the `values` field of the layer encodes a value of any of several types (see below). The `values` represent all the values of features used in the layer, and each value may be referenced by its positional index in this set of `values`, with the first value having an index of 0. The set of `values` SHOULD NOT contain two or more values of the same type which are byte-for-byte identical.

In order to support values of varying string, boolean, integer, and floating point types, the protobuf encoding of the `value` field consists of a set of `optional` fields. A value MUST contain exactly one of these optional fields.

##### 4.4.1.2. Legacy Attribute Keys

The keys for Legacy Attributes are stored in the Layer and follow the rules in section 4.4.3.

#### 4.4.2. Inline Attributes

Feature attributes are encoded as a series of integers in the `attributes` and `geometric_attributes` fields of a feature. Integers come in tuples that are usually pairs (but see below for the cases where more than two integers are required). The first integer in each tuple represents the zero-based index of the key in the `keys` set of the `layer` to which the feature belongs. The second integer (along with 0 or more integers that follow, depending upon the value's type) represents the value of the attribute, and is referred to as a "structured value". Each key index MUST be unique within each feature, such that no other attribute within the same feature has the same key index. The `attributes` and `geometric_attributes` fields of a feature MUST NOT contain a key index greater than or equal to the number of elements in the layer's `keys`.

##### 4.4.2.1. Attributes and geometric attributes

The attributes of a feature are divided between the `attributes` and `geometric_attributes` fields, both of which encode a list of key-value pairs.

Feature attributes that describe the overall feature SHOULD be encoded in the `attributes` field.

Feature attributes that describe additional characteristics of specific locations along the feature's geometry SHOULD be encoded in the `geometric_attributes` field.

Each key-value pair in the `geometric_attributes` MUST have a value whose type is `list` or `number-list`, and whose length is the total number of vertices in the `geometry`. Each element in the list is considered to be associated with the corresponding vertex in the `geometry`. Note that the `geometric_attributes` message *does* include data for `ClosePath` operations, unlike `elevation`, which does not.

##### 4.4.2.2. Structured Value Encoding

Each structured value begins with a 64-bit unsigned integer, which can be split into two parts: the lowest 4 bits are the type bits, and the remaining bits are the parameter bits. What is stored in the parameter bits is dependent on the contents of the type bits. For inline types, the parameter field simply contains a value. For reference types the parameter field is an index position into one of the layer's value fields.

    uint64_t type = structured_value & 0x0F; // least significant 4 bits
    uint64_t parameter = structured_value >> 4;


| Type        |   Id | Parameter      |
| :-----------| ---: | :------------- |
| string      |    0 | index into layer `string_values` |
| float       |    1 | index into layer `float_values` |
| double      |    2 | index into layer `double_values` |
| uint        |    3 | index into layer `int_values` |
| sint        |    4 | index into layer `int_values` (values are zigzag encoded) |
| inline uint |    5 | value of unsigned integer (values between 0 to 2<sup>60</sup>-1) |
| inline sint |    6 | value of zigzag-encoded integer (values between -2<sup>59</sup> to 2<sup>59</sup>-1) |
| null/bool   |    7 | value of 0 = `null`, 1 = `false`, 2 = `true`, other values are not allowed |
| list        |    8 | value is the number of list items to follow: each item in the list is a structured value |
| map         |    9 | value is the number of key-value pairs to follow: each pair is an index into Layer keys followed by a structured value for the value |
| number-list |   10 | parameter is the number of items `N` in the list: one `uint64` is an index into the Layer's `attribute_scalings` followed by `N` `uint64` nullable deltas for the list items |
| bytes       |   11 | index into layer `bytes_values` |

Note that the structured values that follow a list or map may themselves contain lists or maps.

Value types 12 through 15 are reserved for future versions of this specification. Implementations MUST treat structured values of these types as opaque values that consume only one integer of storage (i.e., are not followed by additional sub-attributes). In the future they may refer to additional inline types or additional reference types.

##### 4.4.2.3. Inline Attribute Keys

The keys for Inline Attributes are stored in the Layer and follow the rules in section 4.4.3.

##### 4.4.2.4. Nullable deltas

A number-list encodes a list, each element of which is either a floating point number or `null`.

Each encoded value in the list is either 0, indicating `null`, or a nonzero value that is offset and then unzigzagged to produce a signed integer delta:

    if (encoded_value == 0)
    then:
        value is null
    else:
        sint64 delta = decode_zigzag64(encoded_value - 1);

In the case of a `null`, the current value does not change, and the next delta is relative to the previous non-null value. The initial condition to which the first delta is applied is a value of 0.

As indicated above, just prior to the deltas themselves is a uint64 index into the layer's `attribute_scalings` list. Each non-null delta-encoded value is further scaled and offset by the specified Scaling to produce a final floating point value.

##### 4.4.2.5. Scaling

Elevations and delta-encododed lists are affected by a Scaling specification that maps integer inputs to floating point outputs. For a `delta_encoded_value` integer input, the final floating point `value` output of Scaling is

    value = base + multiplier * (delta_encoded_value + offset)

where `base`, `multiplier`, and `offset` are taken from the Scaling.

All of these fields are optional in the Scaling. If not specified, the `base` and `offset` are 0 and the `multiplier` is 1.

This specification doesn't say anything about which Scaling values to use when encoding the data.

#### 4.4.3. Attribute Keys

For both Inline and Legacy Attributes, the keys are stored in the Layer's `keys` field and are referenced via an index of their sequence in the Layer.  Each element in the `keys` field of the layer is a string. The `keys` include all the keys of features used in the layer, and each key may be referenced by its positional index in this set of `keys`, with the first key having an index of 0. The set of `keys` SHOULD NOT contain two or more values which are byte-for-byte identical.

### 4.5. Example

For example, a GeoJSON feature like:

```json
{
    "type": "FeatureCollection",
    "features": [
        {
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [
                    -8247861.1000836585,
                    4970241.327215323,
                    6.5
                ]
            },
            "type": "Feature",
            "properties": {
                "hello": "world",
                "h": "world",
                "count": 1.23
            }
        },
        {
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [
                    -8247861.1000836585,
                    4970241.327215323,
                    7
                ]
            },
            "type": "Feature",
            "properties": {
                "hello": "again",
                "count": 2
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Could be structured like:

```js
layers {
  version: 2
  name: "points"
  features: {
    id: 1
    attributes: 0
    attributes: 0
    attributes: 1
    attributes: 0
    attributes: 2
    attributes: 2
    type: Point
    geometry: 9
    geometry: 2410
    geometry: 3080
    elevation: 1
  }
  features {
    id: 2
    attributes: 0
    attributes: 16
    attributes: 2
    attributes: 37
    type: Point
    geometry: 9
    geometry: 2410
    geometry: 3080
    elevation: 2
  }
  keys: "hello"
  keys: "h"
  keys: "count"
  string_values: {
    values: "world"
    values: "again"
  }
  double_values: 1.23
  elevation_scaling: {
    base = 6
    multiplier = .5
  }
  extent: 4096
}
```

Keep in mind the exact values for the geometry would differ based on the projection and extent of the tile.

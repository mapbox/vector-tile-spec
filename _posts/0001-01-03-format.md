Vector tiles are encoded as [Google Protobufs](https://github.com/google/protobuf) (PBF), which allow for serializing structured data. For clarity, Mapbox Vector Tiles use the `.mvt` or `.vector.mvt` file suffix. The specification details are largely structured around the rules implemented in the base `.proto` file found [here](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/blob/master/{{site.current}}/vector_tile.proto).

### How are OSM PBF files related to Mapbox Vector Tiles?

They are not related at all. PBFs are a format, much like XML and can take many forms. Mapbox Vector Tiles and OSM PBFs are created as protobuf files, but conform to completely different specifications and are used in different ways.

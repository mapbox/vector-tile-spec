# Mapbox Vector Tile Specification

A specification for encoding tiled vector data. A specification is an important means of setting standards around how data are created and encoded. Just like applications make assumptions about what information exist in a database, Mapbox tools make assumptions about how data are stored in vector tiles. The specification explicitly provides information about file formats & extensions, projection and bounds, and the internal structure of vector tiles. This page aims to shed some light on the specification with

1. how to incorporate the spec into your projects
1. examples of encoding geographic information into vector tiles
1. highlight real-world usage of the Mapbox Vector Tile Specification
1. keep track of specification versions
